## Session 1: Old and new approaches towards material design
**Invited Speaker**: Christopher Sutton

The design and synthesis of novel materials is one of the big challenges in theoretical material science, which requires an accurate description of equilibrium properties of atoms, molecules and solids from first principles.

Due to its numerical efficiency, density-functional theory (DFT) [1] remains the most widespread approach for electronic structure predictions. Hence, there is an ongoing effort to overcome known shortcomings such as the delocalization error and spurious self interactions.
The huge amount of DFT calculations performed worldwide has triggered the creation of online electronic structure databases [2]. These databases not only serve as repositories for electronic structure calculations but also offer the use of novel approaches developed in computer science, e.g. machine learning, to analyze the data in order to guide the design of novel materials [3,4].

In this session, we invite contributions focusing on the development of approximations for ground-state electronic structure methods and the application of big data analysis tools for material research.

## Session 2: Theoretical spectroscopy
**Invited Speaker**: Fabio Caruso, Daniel Karlsson

The behavior of atomic, molecular and solid state systems under perturbations of e.g. electromagnetic fields is relevant to identify their inherent electronic, vibronic and photonic properties. Many techniques have been developed, allowing the investigation by means of theoretical spectroscopy.

These techniques are build around effective descriptions such as time-dependent density functional theory [1] or are based on many body perturbation theories (MBPT), such as the GW approximation [2] or the Bethe-Salpeter equation [3].

In this session, we explore new approaches and take advantage of the existing knowledge to tackle the challenges of predicting excited states structures of modern materials [4] and interpret, understand and predict experimental outcomes of methods, such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy [5].

## Session 3: Modelling properties of complex systems
**Invited Speaker**: Carolin König

Complexity emerges when many degrees of freedom and different spatial scales and time scales are involved. This makes a full ab initio description of such systems challenging. Some processes on large scales can be treated with molecular dynamics approaches [1], which are purely classical. Still, chemical reactions and other electronic processes such as charge transfer or electronic excitations require a quantum mechanical treatment. 

For small atomic and molecular systems a range of ab initio quantum chemical methods, e.g. coupled cluster [2], has been established. For larger systems, combined high-level/low-level descriptions are useful. The system is usually divided into parts, which are then treated on different levels of accuracy, e.g. quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics approaches [3]. There are new developments, e.g. frozen density embedding [4], which allow to treat all parts of a system on a quantum mechanical level separately.

This session focuses on modelling large scale processes like chemical or enzymatic reactions in biological systems [5], photosynthesis [6] or surface catalysis [7] using the full range of methods mentioned above.

## Session 4: Strongly Correlated Electrons, Magnetism, and Topological Phases of Matter
**Invited Speaker**: Laura Fanfarillo

One of many prerequisites for strong correlation is that the interaction energy and the kinetic energy are of the same order of magnitude. Interesting phenomena of solid-state physics, e.g. metal-insulator transitions [1], geometric frustration [2], or topological orders [3], are closely related to the strong correlation between electrons.
Model systems give insight into mechanisms behind phenomena, which are difficult to describe with common approximations used in first principle calculations. Hence, this session focuses on approaches going beyond the scope of standard first principle methods. Such methods are e.g. dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) [4], diagrammatic Monte Carlo methods [5], or tensor network techniques [6]. 

High-Tc superconductivity [7] is an outstanding example for the impact of strong correlations in real materials. In the field of quantum magnetism, spin-waves and magnetic frustration effects draw a lot of attention recently. Phenomena such as the fractional quantum Hall effect or topological insulators [8] are examples of emergent topological phases. Topics like spin liquids [9] combine aspects of all the three fields.

## Session 5: Fermion-boson systems in and out of equilibrium
**Invited Speaker**: Denis Golež

As a common approach to theoretical spectroscopy, the bosonic degrees of freedom can be approximated by effective interactions or dissipation. In the last decades, however, many experiments revealed interesting phenomena that need a more elaborate description, where bosons and fermions are treated on the same quantized footing [1]. 

Incorporating photonic and phononic degrees of freedom ab initio in fermionic systems is a possible but formidable task to be tackled over the next decade. Established methods such as DFT, master equations, MPBT, and strong coupling approaches such as DMFT are getting extended by quantum electrodynamical DFT methods [2] or generalized Kadanoff-Baym approaches [3].

Chemical landscapes of complex molecules that are modified by cavities [4], for instance, have to be described by coupled fermion-boson models. Driven coupled systems even form entirely new states of matter, which lead to extraordinary exciton conductance in organic materials [5], light-induced superconductivity in cuprates [6], or phonon-mediated electron transport [7]. The theoretical description of such phenomena is the main focus of this session.
