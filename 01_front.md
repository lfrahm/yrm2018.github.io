The Young Researchers' Meeting (YRM) of the European Theoretical 
Spectroscopy Facility (ETSF) is an annual conference organized and 
attended exclusively by <i>researchers without permanent position</i> that 
work on state-of-the-art theoretical and computational methods for the 
study of electronic and optical properties of materials. 

Such young researchers are given the chance to present their work, to learn 
novel techniques, to exchange ideas, and to start new collaborations. 
But more importantly, the YRM gives participants the possibility 
to be part of a conference without the usual strong gradient of knowledge 
and experience. We think that it is a unique experience and as many young 
scientists as possible should have the chance to be part of it.

The YRM 2018 will be held from June 4-8 at the CFEL in Hamburg, Germany, 
and will host five topical sessions:

<ol>
<li> Old and new approaches towards material design</li>
<li> Theoretical spectroscopy    </li>
<li> Modelling properties of complex systems </li>
<li> Strongly Correlated Electrons, Magnetism, and Topological Phases of 
Matter </li>
<li> Fermion-boson systems in and out of equilibrium </li>
</ol>

The sessions are guided by a series of lectures, held by 
postdoc-level experts, who give the participants an overview of the field, 
introducing the theoretical framework, state-of-the-art methods and 
open questions. Thus, it will be easier for the participants to 
follow talks and discussions even without too much prior knowledge. 
As a novelty, this year there will be a general introduction lecture to the big 
field of ab-initio research, that then is extended by the traditional introductory 
talks in the several sessions and subsessions. We are happy to announce 
that 7 speakers are already confirmed (see ...) and there is ongoing 
correspondence to more.

As another novel feature of this year's YRM, there will be a so called "open 
session", in which participants for example are encouraged to present the <i>problems</i> 
that they encountered in their research, instead like usual their successes. 
Or one could explain some insights that maybe are not enough to be 
published but were very helpful and could also be useful for others. Or
other things that we have not even thought about. It does not matter. This 
session is meant to be open for your creativity. Please see ... for 
further details.

In addition to the scientific part, the meeting will include a 
session dedicated to talks by researchers from the private sector, who 
will share their experience of working in a non-academic setting.
