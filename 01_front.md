The Young Researchers' Meeting (YRM) of the European Theoretical 
Spectroscopy Facility (ETSF) is an annual conference organized and 
attended exclusively by researchers without permanent position that 
work on state-of-the-art theoretical and computational methods for the 
study of electronic and optical properties of materials. 

It gives young researchers the chance to present their work, to learn 
novel techniques, to exchange ideas, and to start new collaborations. 
But more importantly, the YRM gives participants the possibility 
to be part of a conference without the usual strong gradient of knowledge 
and experience. We think that it is a unique experience and as many young 
scientists as possible should have the chance to be part of it.

The YRM 2018 will be held from June 4-8 at the CFEL in Hamburg, Germany, 
and will host five topical sessions:

<ol>
<li> Old and new approaches towards material design</li>
<li> Theoretical spectroscopy    </li>
<li> Modelling properties of complex systems </li>
<li> Strongly Correlated Electrons, Magnetism, and Topological Phases of 
Matter </li>
<li> Fermion-boson systems in and out of equilibrium </li>
</ol>

The sessions are guided by a series of lectures, held by 
postdoc-level experts. They give the participants an overview of the field, 
introducing the theoretical framework, state-of-the-art methods and 
open questions. Thus it will be easier for the participants to 
follow talks and discussions that are far away from their own scope. 
There will be a general introduction of the big 
field of ab-initio research, that then is extended by introductory 
talks in the several sessions and 
subsessions. 

As a novel feature of this year's YRM, there will be a so called "open 
session", in which participants for example can present the PROBLEMS 
they that in their research instead of their successes, or just explain 
some already known but in the recent year's forgotten issues, etc. This 
session is meant to be open for your creativity. Please see ... for 
further details.

In addition to the scientific sessions, the meeting will include a 
session dedicated to talks by researchers from the private sector, who 
will share their experience of working in a non-academic setting.
